                    👋 Hey there, I'm Daniel, a software engineer primarily focused on web development.
                </Typography>
                <Typography gutterBottom>This blog is where I share my knowledge on topics I'm passionate about, as well as document my problem-solving journey.</Typography>
                <Typography gutterBottom>
                    I specialize in Node.js, Java, Go, and AWS, with deep experience in auth systems, customer-facing APIs, and multi-tenant B2B SaaS. I also occasionally dabble in Unity and contribute to open-source projects when I have the chance.
                </Typography>
